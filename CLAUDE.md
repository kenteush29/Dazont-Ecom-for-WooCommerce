# Dazont Ecom — project rules

WooCommerce plugin (`dazont-ecom/`) for kula-tactical.com. Admin UI in English,
owner communicates in French.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Every new function/module MUST be registered in the module catalog**
  (`includes/class-modules.php` → `catalog()`): boot class(es), group, label,
  a short one-line description AND a detailed popup description (`more`) —
  both accurate, written from what the code actually does, no "AI" branding.
  Modules boot ONLY through `DZE_Modules::boot()`; never instantiate a module
  directly in `dazont-ecom.php`.
- **A disabled module must leave ZERO trace in the admin**: its own hooks
  vanish with boot, but every CROSS-module surface (settings tabs, dashboard
  blocks, bridge buttons) must be gated with `DZE_Modules::enabled( $id )` —
  `class_exists()` is NOT a module check (class files always exist).
- One settings menu only: the Settings page (class-marketing-ai.php tabs).
  New settings go into an existing tab or a new tab there — never a separate
  submenu (fallback submenus only to avoid lock-outs).
- API keys are never committed. Constants: `DZE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `DZE_FAL_API_KEY`, `DZE_GMC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`. Each key is only ever sent to
  its own provider.
- Shipped default prompts are precious (the owner's spreadsheet prompts,
  verbatim). Custom edits live in settings; empty/absent = shipped default,
  and every prompt UI offers a "Restore default" path.
- WPML compatibility everywhere.
- New/unfinished features ship to the DEV channel only (`Plugin-development`
  branch → prerelease); `Live-plugin` (stable) only with explicit approval.

## Traps learned the hard way

- `update_option()` on our registered options re-runs the sanitize callback
  (shaped for FORM input). Programmatic saves of canonical data must use
  `DZE_Content::write_settings_direct()`-style writes (filter removed around
  the write) + a read-back check. Never let registry()/read paths persist.
- fal.ai sources: local files go as base64 data URIs; only fal's own CDN
  hosts are accepted as remote sources (`DZE_Content::is_fal_url`).
- Every fal/Anthropic call records usage in `DZE_Ai_Usage` and respects the
  monthly budget guard.

## Release pipeline

- Version bump in `dazont-ecom/dazont-ecom.php` (header + `DZE_VERSION`).
- Push working branch + `Plugin-development`, then dispatch
  `release-dazont-dev.yml` (workflow_dispatch; tag pushes are blocked by the
  git proxy). Stable: `release-dazont.yml` on `Live-plugin`.
- Build the zip (`dazont-ecom/` folder) and send it to the owner each version.
